# ros2_console
Console/logging facilities for ROS 2.

**NOTE**: This is not a fully functioning logging capability

This adds basic console logging support for ROS 2. This does NOT add full support for logging, it is intended to be used to make porting to ROS 2 easier during the time when ROS 2 does not having a logging mechanism.
